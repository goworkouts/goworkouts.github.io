Aerobic Exercise Increases Brain Volume, Improves Memory From medindia.net
Researchers found that participants who exercised aerobically four times a week for six months showed greater increases in brain volume. While aerobic exercise elevates neurotransmitters and creates new blood vessels that pipe in growth factors and spawns new cells, complex activities put all that material to use by strengthening and expanding networks. Physical activity may play a role in both the prevention and slowing of brain volume loss and may be beneficial in terms of improving the functional connectivity of brain regions. Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts.
