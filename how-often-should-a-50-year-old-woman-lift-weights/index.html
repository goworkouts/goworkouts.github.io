We do not recommend weight training more than 5 times a week as this can overexert your body and make an injury more likely. Push your arms up behind you while pulling your shoulder blades together and your back straight until you feel the stretch in your chest. Hit the muscles slowly, using full range of motion, extending, squeezing, and fatiguing the muscle effectively, while focusing on your heart rate and breathing. As with any form of exercise, however, the benefits also come with some risk, and those risks increase as we age.
