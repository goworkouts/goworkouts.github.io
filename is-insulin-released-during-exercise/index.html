<p>With exercise, insulin is not readily released from the pancreas due to the lowered blood glucose levels. In people who have a pancreas that functions normally, insulin levels typically decrease during exercise, and levels of a hormone called glucagon (released from the alpha cells of the pancreas) rise to stimulate glucose release (1). As you exercise, your muscles metabolize glucose, and the waste products of that metabolic process are carried by the bloodstream to the lungs to be exhaled…. However, during exercise there was an increase (p &lt; 0.05, time effect) and a decrease (p &lt; 0.05, time effect) in plasma glucagon and insulin, respectively, which resulted in an elevated (p &lt; 0.05, time effect) glucagon:insulin molar ratio (table 2).
