Chapter 10 Respiration Lesson 1 Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration a… From slideshare.net
Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Aerobic respiration is more efficient than.

<p>Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.

It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp.

<p>Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (o2) in order to create atp. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. Cellular Respiration.</p>
