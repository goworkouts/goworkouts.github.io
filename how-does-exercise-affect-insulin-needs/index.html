<p>Regardless, exercising with diabetes will help your body lower the overall amount of glucose in your blood without added insulin. Several shorter sessions can add up over the day. When first beginning a weight training regimen, test your blood sugar levels frequently before, during, and after exercise to help determine what a safe exercise plan is for you and your specific needs. The researchers demonstrated that in healthy people, exercise intensity probably doesn’t matter much when it comes to improving the body’s insulin systems.

<p>Specifically in people with type 2 diabetes, exercise can improve insulin sensitivity as well as help lower elevated blood glucose levels to keep them in the normal range. Insulin sensitivity is your body’s ability to pull glucose out of the blood stream and put it into your cells so that glucose can be used for energy or fuel for the cell. Insulin sensitivity is increased, so your muscle cells are better able to use any available insulin to take up glucose. We investigated the influence of a program of exercise training consisting of three weekly sessions, each 45 min long, for 12 wk, on indices of physical fitness, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity in nine adolescents with type i diabetes; This is how physical exercise affects blood glucose levels poarol.</p>
