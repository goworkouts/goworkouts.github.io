Effect Of Training On The Anaerobic Energy System Amy T From slideshare.net
Quick, powerful, explosive movements, like jumping, hopping, skipping, jump squats, and jump lunges. This is in contrast with anaerobic exercise which is driven by energy sources within the muscles and not by oxygen uptake. The biochemistry of anaerobic exercise involves a process called glycolysis, in which glucose. Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles.

Hence, aerobic exercise can be defined as the one, which involves the use of oxygen to produce energy, whereas anaerobic exercise makes the body to produce energy without using oxygen.
