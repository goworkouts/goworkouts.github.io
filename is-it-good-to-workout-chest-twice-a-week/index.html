Lift Like a Girl Dumbell Workout From pixie-booth.com
It’s just not mostly optimal. I would consider 2x a week a minimum for any lagging body part. Do this exercise with a wide (wish) grip, flare the elbows out to the side (rather than keeping them tucked closed to your body) and row the bar closer to the chest. This is a great routine for advanced lifters, or those who have had experience with training body parts twice per week.
