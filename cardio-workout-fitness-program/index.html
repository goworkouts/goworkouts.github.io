Power Cardio 30Day Fitness Program Workout, Cardio workout, Hiit From pinterest.com
Add cardio between the abdominal moves to keep your heart rate up—as a boxer, he knows cardio is king as a functional element of endurance. Sit on the ground with your shoulders on a bench or stable chair behind you. Perform the paired exercises (marked “a” and “b”) as alternating sets, so you’ll complete one set of “a,” rest as directed, then one set of “b,” and repeat until all sets are. Cramming 30 minutes of boring mindless cardio into 15 minutes is nice, but the oxygen debt you create can release more.
