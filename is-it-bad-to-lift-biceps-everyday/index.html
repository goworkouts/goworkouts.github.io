I&#39;m hitting my biceps 3 times a week and they are growing nicely. In the scope of all the potential exercises you could do, i&#39;d say bicep curls are inefficient. Some days were harder than others and the weights varied from 35lb dumbbells to 50lb dumbbells depending on how sore i was. While doing bicep curls every day is a great tactic to improve bicep size, we would need to work up to this weekly allotment.
