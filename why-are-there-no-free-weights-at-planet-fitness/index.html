<p>Remember that, rather than fitness fanatics, planet fitness caters to everyday individuals who want to exercise and be healthy. Just one walk through the weight machine area of the gym will show you that if there's a muscle that can be strengthened, there's a machine for the job! Free weights or dunces that are basic in virtually all gyms are limited in the weight procured. The gym equipment like power racks and dumbbell bench press is nowhere to be found here.</p>
