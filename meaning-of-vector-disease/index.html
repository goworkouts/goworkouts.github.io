Vector Borne Disease From slideshare.net
The organisms or animals which are involved in spreading or transmitting the disease are known as vectors or carriers. They can be caused by either parasites, bacteria or viruses. A vector is defined as any animal that transmits disease causing organisms (pathogens or germs) into a host. For example, in malaria a mosquito is the vector that carries and transfers the infectious agent.
