In simple terms, afterburn is additional energy your body expends after you’ve finished exercising. The main issue here then is not so much whether or not cardio will burn muscle, but to what extent it will and how much of it you have to do to decrease muscle. It also helps account for the fact your body continues burning calories long after your workout is over. This occurs because the body needs a large amount of oxygen to repair the muscles in the hours following the exercise.
