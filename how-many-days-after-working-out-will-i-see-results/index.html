<p>The key is to assess how much time you are prepared to invest in your workout. Significant weight loss and muscle gains will take approximately eight weeks to see, however, even though you’re not seeing muscle definition, the benefits going on in your body and mind are considerable. A beginner can see as much as 2 ½ pounds of muscle gain per month. If you are new to training, or have taken a long break, you can expect to see results in about a month. Definitely agree with this, I see so many people give up being.</p>
