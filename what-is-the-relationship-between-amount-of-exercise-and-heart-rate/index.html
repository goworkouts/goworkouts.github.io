<p>What is the relationship between type of exercise, heart rate, and recovery time?_____ 6. Heart rate is the number of times your heart beats in a minute. This results in a direct, positive relationship between your heart, breathing and physical activity rates. Heart rate is the amount of poundings of the heart per unit of time, usually in beats per minute (bpm). PPT VO 2 max PowerPoint Presentation, free download ID1154710.</p>

<p>The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm. The normal resting heart rate of an adult human ranges from 60 to100 beats per minute.
