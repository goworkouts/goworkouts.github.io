Benefits of weight training for men over 60. Weight training in older adults will also increase power output, makes performing tasks and moving around easier, improves body composition (reduces fat/increases muscle mass), improves insulin sensitivity, improves fat metabolism (reduces blood cholesterol), and improves balance. The most obvious benefit of weight training for older men is the improvement in physical performance. You need to lift a weight heavy enough to damage muscle fibers to make a muscle bigger and stronger, but causing more damage than that.

This is rule number one for all older lifters dealing with chronic injury issues.</p>
