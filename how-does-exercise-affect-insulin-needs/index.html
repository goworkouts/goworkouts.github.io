<p>Specifically in people with type 2 diabetes, exercise can improve insulin sensitivity as well as help lower elevated blood glucose levels to keep them in the normal range. Insulin sensitivity is your bodyâs ability to pull glucose out of the blood stream and put it into your cells so that glucose can be used for energy or fuel for the cell. Insulin sensitivity is increased, so your muscle cells are better able to use any available insulin to take up glucose.
