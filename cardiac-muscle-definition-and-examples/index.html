<p>Cardiac muscle, which is also called myocardium, in the vertebrates, is one of three major muscle types that is only found in the heart. Cardiac muscle is one of three kinds of muscles, the others being skeletal and smooth. They are connected end to end by intercalated disks and are organized into layers of myocardial tissue that are wrapped around the chambers of the heart. Cardiac muscle (heart muscle) is a striated (striped) muscle found in the heart's walls. Pin on Health and medicine illustrated.</p>
