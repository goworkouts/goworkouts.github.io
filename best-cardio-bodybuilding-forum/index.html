One is that cardio adds extra volume to your training, making it difficult to recover from normal lifting.4 other researchers maintain that the physiological adaptations that follow cardio training are the complete opposite of those which occur with lifting weights, and that cardiovascular gains are. So with gyms still being closed a lot of us are able to do mainly cardio. I completely hate cardio and since i have a limited attention span i jump machines to prevent myself from getting completely bored outta my mind. After my workout today, i was talking to a bodybuilder at my gym, and the subject of cardio came up.
