Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration Bio Differences From biodifferences.net
Two types of cellular respiration exist: This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Different types of respiration can also depend. The differences between aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration include where the processes occur, what chemicals are involved in the processes, and what substances are produced by the two processes.
