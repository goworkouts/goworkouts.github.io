<p>The human body has 3 main methods for using energy to sustain itself and fuel exercise. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes.  aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. Aerobic endurance means literally ‘with oxygen’.</p>

<p>Aerobic endurance training is any form of training that uses oxygen to meet energy demands and is generally performed at a light to moderate intensity. Aerobic (which means “using oxygen”) physical activity, in which the body’s larger muscles move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time and increase the body’s need for oxygen, are the best exercises to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance. But i wouldn’t have gotten far without. Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise.

<p>In fact it has three such systems and all are used simultaneously during all types of physical activity, though some more than others depending on what you’re doing. In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991). During aerobic exercise, your heart pumps oxygenated blood to working muscles to help them burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel, which in turn enables you to perform for extended periods.

<p>In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991). This means that the aerobic energy system relies on the circulatory system (breathing in oxygen) in order to create adenosine triphosphate (atp) for energy use.

<p>During aerobic exercise, your heart pumps oxygenated blood to working muscles to help them burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel, which in turn enables you to perform for extended periods. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy.

<p>Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991). This means that the aerobic energy system relies on the circulatory system (breathing in oxygen) in order to create adenosine triphosphate (atp) for energy use. The aerobic system, also known as aerobic glycolysis, powers continuous steady state exercise longer than three to four minutes. What is the definition of aerobic respiration? Quora.</p>

<p>It is the forgotten training threshold, overshadowed by its big brother, the anaerobic threshold. Your cardiovascular fitness level is measured in terms of the amount of oxygen pumped by your heart throughout your body to your active muscles. It also uses fats, glucose, carbohydrates, and proteins. Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise.

Aerobic (which means “using oxygen”) physical activity, in which the body’s larger muscles move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time and increase the body’s need for oxygen, are the best exercises to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance. The human body has 3 main methods for using energy to sustain itself and fuel exercise. Aerobic respiration plays a significant role in releasing a lot of energy which helps in the survival of life.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-definition-of-aerobic-endurance">What Is The Definition Of Aerobic Endurance?</h3><p>aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. It is demonstrated by a leveling off or decline in oxygen consumption with increasing intensity. This means that the aerobic energy system relies on the circulatory system (breathing in oxygen) in order to create adenosine triphosphate (atp) for energy use. It’s a lot more complicated than this, but in essence, think of the aerobic system as using oxygen as its primary fuel source.</p>

Strengthening the heart and lungs by making them work hard for several minutes or more. During aerobic exercise, your heart pumps oxygenated blood to working muscles to help them burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel, which in turn enables you to perform for extended periods. It releases a large amount of energy in comparison to anaerobic respiration.</p>
