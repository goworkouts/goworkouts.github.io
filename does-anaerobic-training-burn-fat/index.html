<p>The importance of anaerobic training is gaining more and more weight in the fitness world. We show how it works exactly and what you have to keep in mind during training. Anaerobic exercise refers to strength or speed training that does not use oxygen. One of the additional benefits of anaerobic exercise is the effect on your musculature.</p>

<p>The cardio portion of class is an excellent form of aerobic exercise while the strength training is anaerobic and will help you develop lean muscle that burns more fat. And hiit/anaerobic exercise isn't about burning fat during the session. However, even though it does use a greater percentage of stored body fat for energy as opposed to glycogen, it burns a lesser amount of total energy than does certain forms of anaerobic exercise. Calling a workout aerobic or anaerobic is slightly misleading because your body is always using both systems to make energy.

<p>The best type of exercise to burn unhealthy belly fat is aerobic exercise, according to a new study. Gh is released by the body in greater quantities in response to physical stress above the lactate threshold, which is the reason heavy, sprints are so effective. The reason anaerobic interval training works so much better is that it requires the body to adapt metabolically—your body is forced to burn fat to sustain the level of intensity being asked of it.
