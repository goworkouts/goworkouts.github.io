5 Tips from a Personal Trainer for Starting Your Fitness Journey From ncan.us
First, it’s worth noting that soreness may not indicate that you&#39;ve had a good workout. Start with a gentle walk or easy spin on a stationary bike for 5 to 10 minutes. Being sore the next day or day after is a good sign you&#39;ve obliterated the muscle but if it doesn&#39;t hurt dont mean you haven&#39;t worked it efficiently. Do legs one day and exercise your upper body the next.
