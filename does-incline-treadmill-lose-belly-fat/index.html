To promote fat reduction in the belly area, you have to be aiming to reduce fat all over your body. Incline treadmill walking for fat loss is widely preferred. The problem is that the vast majority of men and women who aim to shed fat in their midsection cling onto the treadmill, their feet simply gliding over the fast tread as their entire body tilts back, reproducing the same angle that occurs when walking on a flat surface! Walking on an incline treadmill can help you burn fat without losing muscle.
