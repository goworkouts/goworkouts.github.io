The anaerobic threshold is the highest exercise intensity that you can sustain for a prolonged period without lactate substantially building up in your blood.

<p>Anaerobic capacity is at the pointy tip of the spear for many athletes. While there are a number of ways to measure aerobic capacity (more on this below), think of aerobic capacity as the volume of oxygen pumped through your body in a given amount of time.

So what is p max p max is the maximum power over at least a full pedal revolution with both legs it’s measured in watts or in watts per kilogram. The wingate anaerobic test is arguably one of the most famous laboratory fitness tests.

In this episode, i’ll clearly define more of what that means. Your measured heart rate at each point can then be plotted against workload to get an estimate of your aerobic capacity.

<p>It has been documented that there is a greater anaerobic capacity in men than women during maximal intensity exercise, both when absolute and bm corrected estimates of anaerobic capacity are applied. This absolute result/outcome expressed as a percentage of body weight will show the relative maximum anaerobic power (w/ kg).
