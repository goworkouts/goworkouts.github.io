Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. Researchers have established that a person doing anaerobic workouts loses more calories than one doing aerobics on ratios of 5 to 1 or even 7 to 1.the aerobics burn up to around 25% muscle and 75% body fat while on the other hand, the anaerobic workouts tend to burn 100% body fat. Your heart rate goes up, increasing blood flow. Your heart rate goes up, increasing blood flow.
