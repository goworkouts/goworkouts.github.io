People can use it to determine whether they are exercising at the optimal intensity. For most people target exercise heart rate levels are: Rhr was measured by a heart rate monitor and physical activity was assessed in total and in three different domains (school, occupational, and sports practice) by.

<p>An athleteâs heart muscle has built up overtime and become stronger due to the constant exercise an athlete participates in. A way to understand and measure the intensity of aerobic activity is by understanding intensity and how physical activity affects heart rate and breathing. Therefore, their heart needs less beats to pump the oxygenated blood to the muscles in need of it. Resting heart rate, and physical activity, starting when the participants were middle.</p>

An average resting heart rate is between 60 to 100 beats a minute. Rpe is a measure of physical activity intensity level which relies upon the individualâs personal perception of how much effort is being exerted during activity.although this measure is somewhat subjective, the borg rating of perceived exertion scale (figure 1) appears to be a reasonably accurate estimate of heart rate during physical.
