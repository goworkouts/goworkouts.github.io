<meta name="description" content="Free Example Of Anaerobic Lactic System Physical Activities In Office, During the lifting of weights the muscles operate at maximum capacity, fulfilling the designated task during a short interval of time, because one is not going to the breathing to renew the energies. Anaerobic exercise is exercise without oxygen, in other words, exercise that does not get you breathing hard.
Lesson 1 From slideshare.net
As an example here, we can take the 400m sprint. Each energy system is used in differing amounts. Our body is able to store about 500 total grams of glycogen in the muscle and liver tissue which provides around 2,000 calories worth of energy. Physical activities of anaerobic lactic energy system.

<p>Examples of anaerobic exercise include heavy weight training, sprinting (running or cycling) and jumping. During exercise, your body relies on three basic energy systems: Our body is able to store about 500 total grams of glycogen in the muscle and liver tissue which provides around 2,000 calories worth of energy.
