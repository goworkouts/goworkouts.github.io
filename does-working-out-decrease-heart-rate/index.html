<h3 id="this-gives-a-really-good-indication-of-your-fitness-and-your-bodys-ability-to-recover">This Gives A Really Good Indication Of Your Fitness And Your Body’s Ability To Recover.</h3><p>A 1992 study found that an increase in resting heart rate is one of the primary predictors of overtraining. Your resting pulse naturally increases as you get older, but your maximum heart rate decreases. To find the target heart rate range for your age, subtract your age from 220 and then multiply that number by 0.60 and by 0.80 to find the low and high ends of the range. Sometimes, though, your heart rate will decrease during a workout.</p>

If you are 40 years old, for instance, this formula will tell you that your target range for healthy exercise is about 108 to 144 beats a minute. It allows it to pump a greater amount of blood with each heartbeat. Then, as you become more fit, you can progress to 70 to 85 percent of your target heart rate.</p>
