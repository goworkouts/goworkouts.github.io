The capacity and strength of the lungs is measured before and during exercise. The information gathered during a cpet is used to calculate peak vo2 (the highest level of oxygen consumption attained at peak exercise). Cardiopulmonary exercise test, or cpet, uses exercise to evaluate the heart and lungs. Cardiopulmonary exercise test, or cpet, uses exercise to evaluate the heart and lungs.
