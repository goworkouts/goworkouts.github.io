Benefits of HIIT Benefits of High Intensity Interval Training From blueskymd.com
In essence, hiit training is doing an exercise of high intensity or at a person’s max capacity for a short period. Hiit offers a big calorie burn, revs up your metabolism, aids in weight loss and builds strength and muscle. As a workout of high intensity, it doesn’t require much time to complete and is a great way to integrate exercise into your daily routine. Hiit isn’t necessarily about the exercise, the equipment, or the workout location.
