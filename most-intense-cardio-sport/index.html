When we want to lose weight, when we face any health problem that our body needs to be stronger, or in our intense exercise programs, cardio is a type of exercise that is a part of our lives, consciously or unconsciously. Running and jigging help to elevate your heart rate, but if you are too slow in the process, this might not be a very effective exercise. The studies that confirm the effectiveness of hiit have subjects performing intervals.
