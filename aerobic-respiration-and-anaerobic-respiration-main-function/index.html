biochemistry How does the body switch between aerobic and anaerobic From biology.stackexchange.com
Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. Gases are exchanged in this form of respiration. It can be found in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. So, they begin to respire anaerobically in order to obtain the energy they.

<p>In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. In addition to aerobic respiration, there is also anaerobic respiration, which is the conversion of sugars into energy in environments where oxygen isnât present. Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. The product of respiration is a molecule called adenosine. Bacterial aerobic respiration.</p>
