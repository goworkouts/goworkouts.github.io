<p>Although the study showed that there was no direct effect of exercise on cognition from before to after intervention, there was an association between increases in fitness and improvements in cognition. As the brain ages, it becomes more important for a person to exercise for their cognitive health. Some studies have found that aerobic exercise improves these features in adults above 55, and stern says that a larger study may be able to detect improvement in younger adults.
