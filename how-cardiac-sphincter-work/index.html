What Causes Esophageal Sphincter Pain? (with pictures) From wisegeek.com
The external sphincter muscle surrounds the area of the urethra outside the bladder. The key difference between cardiac and pyloric sphincter is that cardiac sphincter is present at the upper portion of the stomach and closes off the top end of the stomach while pyloric sphincter is present at the lower end of the stomach and closes off the bottom of the stomach. It is a smooth, involuntary muscle. The lower esophageal sphincter is a ring muscle at the point where the esophagus connects to the stomach.
