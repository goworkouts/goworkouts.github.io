I would like to include chest again maybe on thursdays but then where could i include my bi&#39;s and tri&#39;s. Upper/lower split twice a week. Here is the problem i am having.

<p>But truthfully its better to just kill the chest once a week and let it heal and grow. The best workout for training body parts twice a week is as follows. Don't neglect pulling motions (rows, pullups, etc.) or leg work, to hit chest more. Also having a lagging body part will do so, make sure you hit lateral and rear delts as hard as you hit anterior because anterior deltoid is used in most chest exercises and having an imbalance will lead to issues.
