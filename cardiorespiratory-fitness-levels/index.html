<meta name="description" content="Popular Cardiorespiratory Fitness Levels At Home, Your doctor can measure cardiorespiratory fitness through what&#39;s called your maximal oxygen consumption (vo2 max) or from readings taken while you do an aerobic workout. Over the past 20 years, several studies have shown that individuals with low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (unfit individuals) have higher systolic blood pressure (sbp) and diastolic blood pressure (dbp) at rest than fit individuals, thereby increasing cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk.
Cardiorespiratory Fitness Levels Among US Youth 12 to 19 Years of Age From jamanetwork.com
Muscular strength—the amount of force a muscle or muscle group can exert against a resistance. In this study, the risk of low cardiorespiratory fitness exceeded. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. This information can benefit everyone, not just professional athletes.

<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) measures how well your body is able to transport and utilize oxygen during any sustained physical activity. It can reduce the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and other diseases. It also increases the production of endorphins, which are natural painkillers and mood lifters produced by the brain. Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) and physical inactivity have been associated with increased risk of several chronic diseases, including coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and some forms of cancer.blair et al.
